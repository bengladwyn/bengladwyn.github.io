2024-12-02,MINOS,MINOS (Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search) was an experiment at Fermilab that studied neutrino oscillations using a beam directed 735 km to the Soudan Underground Laboratory. The near and far detectors were 980 tons and 5.4 kilo-tons respectively. They were made of steel and plastic scintillators and provided key measurements of neutrino mass-squared differences.,https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/sites/default/files/styles/2015_hero/public/images/standard/MINOS-s.jpg
