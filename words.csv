2024-12-02,MINOS,MINOS (Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search) was an experiment at Fermilab that studied neutrino oscillations using a beam directed 735 km to the Soudan Underground Laboratory. The near and far detectors were 980 tons and 5.4 kilo-tons respectively. They were made of steel and plastic scintillators and provided key measurements of neutrino mass-squared differences.,https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/sites/default/files/styles/2015_hero/public/images/standard/MINOS-s.jpg
2024-12-03,GLUON,A gluon is a massless particle that mediates the strong interaction between quarks binding them into hadrons like protons and neutrons. As a massless vector boson with spin 1 it carries the color charge of the strong force making quantum chromodynamics (QCD) more complex than quantum electrodynamics (QED). The term "gluon" was coined by Murray Gell-Mann in 1962 likening it to an adhesive that holds the nucleus together. Gluons along with quarks were referred to as partons by Richard Feynman.,https://www.sciencefacts.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gluon.jpg 
2024-12-04,FASER,FASER (or Forward Search Experiment) searches for light and weakly interacting particles predicted by models beyond the Standard Model. These particles could explain dark matter and neutrino masses and the matter-antimatter imbalance. The main LHC detectors cannot detect such particles as they are produced parallel to the proton beamline so FASER is located 480 meters downstream of ATLAS along the beam trajectory where it can detect the decay of these particles. FASERν is a subdetector designed to detect neutrinos. FASERν uses tungsten plates and emulsion films as a target and detector to study these interactions. FASER was installed during CERN's 2019 to 2021 long shutdown and began taking data in July 2022., https://cds.cern.ch/images/CERN-PHOTO-202011-156-12/file?size=medium
