2024-12-03,GLUON,A gluon is a massless particle that mediates the strong interaction between quarks binding them into hadrons like protons and neutrons. As a massless vector boson with spin 1 it carries the color charge of the strong force making quantum chromodynamics (QCD) more complex than quantum electrodynamics (QED). The term "gluon" was coined by Murray Gell-Mann in 1962 likening it to an adhesive that holds the nucleus together. Gluons along with quarks were referred to as partons by Richard Feynman.,https://www.sciencefacts.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gluon.jpg 
2024-12-04,FASER,FASER (or Forward Search Experiment) searches for light and weakly interacting particles predicted by models beyond the Standard Model. These particles could explain dark matter and neutrino masses and the matter-antimatter imbalance.

FASERν is a subdetector designed to detect neutrinos. FASERν uses tungsten plates and emulsion films as a target and detector to study these interactions. FASER was installed during CERN's 2019 to 2021 long shutdown and began taking data in July 2022., https://cds.cern.ch/images/CERN-PHOTO-202011-156-12/file?size=medium
