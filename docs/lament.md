# A Hedge Fund Manager’s Lament

O thou who seek within the laws abiding,<br>
In which the spirit’d souls of quick mind delves,<br>
When, in avarice blind, their passion shelves,<br>
For great funds of symmetry subsiding -<br>
A plight with dreams no longer colliding,<br>
And to chase the yield, a fate it impels,<br>
Towards the sole discovery it compels,<br>
Boneless and broken in this residing!<br>
Yet now I see the spinor to be spun,<br>
To unravel the celestial lore,<br>
And whilst stars narrate how our tales begun,<br>
It is particles I wish to explore -<br>
Though finance whispers, in physics I hum,<br>
Within these wonders, I’ll seek evermore.<br>
